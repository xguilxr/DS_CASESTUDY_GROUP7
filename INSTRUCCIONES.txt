Attached is the dataset with hourly energy load data for a period of 2 years and other climacteric variables.
1. Analyze variables, fill in missing values, normalize extreme values.
2. Analyse the correlation between variables by using three frequency of data:
Hourly, daily, weekly.
For daily/weekly frequency aggregate the data (for each variable using the sum or average values depending on the significance the aggregation has for the specifies variable. For ex. It makes sense the average temperature and not sum of temperature)
3. Obtain prediction models (for each frequency of observation: hourly, daily, weekly) . Feel free to use statistical and/or machine learning models, or ensemble models.
Compare different models (between the same frequency) and clearly state your final decision of the "best" model which can be used for prediction of energy load.
